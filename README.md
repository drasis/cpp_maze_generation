### MAZE GENERATOR

I've implemented 7 algorithms in C++ to procedurally generate perfect two-dimensional mazes! Perfect mazes contain no loops, and for each point in the maze, there is exactly one path to any other point in the maze. One of the algorithms I implemented takes a 2D bitmask as an input, so it can generate mazes in different shapes. [This webpage](https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm) is an excellent primer on maze classification and the tradoffs/biases of different maze generation algorithms. TODO (one day): use openCV's contour detection on images to algorithmically generate mazes that loosely resemble [Christopher Berg's hand-drawn mazes](http://www.amazeingart.com/free-mazes/more-free-mazes.html).
